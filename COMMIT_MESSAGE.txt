Add database connection validation across all functionality

- Add TestConnection method to DatabaseSchemaExtractor class
  - Validates connection string and tests database accessibility
  - Returns detailed connection information (server, database, version, table count)
  - Provides comprehensive error details on failure

- Integrate connection validation into ExtractSchema and RestoreDatabase
  - Connection validation enabled by default (can be disabled via parameter)
  - Validates connection before proceeding with extraction/restore operations
  - Provides early failure detection with clear error messages

- Add connection test API endpoint
  - POST /api/files/test-connection
  - Accepts connection string and optional timeout
  - Returns ConnectionTestResult with validation details

- Add test_connection MCP tool
  - Exposes connection testing via Model Context Protocol
  - Supports all SQL Server connection types (local, LocalDB, Azure SQL)
  - Includes examples in EXAMPLES.md

- Update all documentation
  - DatabaseExtractor README: Added TestConnection and RestoreDatabase sections
  - FileDownloadApi README: Added test-connection endpoint documentation
  - McpServer EXAMPLES.md: Added connection test examples

This ensures all database operations validate connectivity before execution,
reducing runtime errors and providing better user feedback.
